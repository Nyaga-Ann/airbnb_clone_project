## üß© Database Design

This section outlines the key entities in the Airbnb Clone project, their essential fields, and relationships between them.

### 1. **User**
- `user_id` (Primary Key)
- `username`
- `email`
- `password`
- `date_joined`

> Represents individuals using the platform‚Äîeither hosts or guests. A user can create listings, make bookings, and leave reviews.

### 2. **Property**
- `property_id` (Primary Key)
- `owner_id` (Foreign Key to User)
- `title`
- `description`
- `location`

> Represents the available properties listed for booking. Each property is associated with a user (host).

### 3. **Booking**
- `booking_id` (Primary Key)
- `user_id` (Foreign Key to User)
- `property_id` (Foreign Key to Property)
- `check_in`
- `check_out`

> Represents a reservation made by a user for a specific property. Each booking belongs to one property and one user.

### 4. **Review**
- `review_id` (Primary Key)
- `user_id` (Foreign Key to User)
- `property_id` (Foreign Key to Property)
- `rating`
- `comment`

> Stores feedback provided by guests after their stay. Each review is linked to a property and the reviewer.

### 5. **Payment**
- `payment_id` (Primary Key)
- `booking_id` (Foreign Key to Booking)
- `amount`
- `payment_method`
- `status`

> Tracks payment transactions related to bookings. Each payment is tied to a single booking.

---

### üîó Entity Relationships

- A **User** can have multiple **Properties** (as a host).
- A **User** can make multiple **Bookings**.
- A **Property** can have multiple **Bookings** and **Reviews**.
- A **Booking** is associated with one **User**, one **Property**, and one **Payment**.
- A **Review** is written by a **User** about a **Property**.

## üßæ Feature Breakdown

This section outlines the core features planned for the backend of the Airbnb Clone project, describing their purpose and functionality.

### 1. **User Management**
Handles user registration, login, logout, profile updates, and role assignment. Ensures that only authenticated users can access specific features based on their roles (e.g., guest or host).

### 2. **Property Management**
Allows hosts to create, update, and delete property listings. Each listing includes details like title, description, images, location, and pricing.

### 3. **Booking System**
Enables guests to book available properties. Includes functionality to select dates, check availability, and confirm reservations.

### 4. **Review System**
Provides users the ability to leave reviews and ratings after completing a booking. Helps improve transparency and trust in the platform.

### 5. **Payment Handling**
Processes payments securely for confirmed bookings. Includes support for various payment statuses and methods while ensuring transaction integrity.

### 6. **Authentication & Authorization**
Implements secure login and access control across the system. Includes features such as token-based authentication and role-based permissions.

## üîê API Security

Securing the backend API is critical to protect user data, financial transactions, and system integrity. The following measures will be implemented:

### 1. **Authentication**
Users must log in using secure credentials to receive a token (e.g., JWT). This token is required to access protected endpoints, ensuring that only valid users can interact with the system.

### 2. **Authorization**
Role-based access control (RBAC) will be used to ensure that users only perform actions permitted by their role (e.g., guests cannot delete properties).

### 3. **Rate Limiting**
To prevent abuse or brute-force attacks, rate limiting will be enforced on sensitive endpoints like login or booking creation.

### 4. **Input Validation & Sanitization**
All incoming data will be validated to prevent SQL injection, XSS, and other malicious input vulnerabilities.

### 5. **Secure Password Storage**
User passwords will be hashed using strong algorithms (e.g., bcrypt) before being stored in the database.

These measures help maintain the trust, safety, and functionality of the platform.

 ## üöÄ CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?
CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment/Delivery. It is a development practice that enables teams to deliver code changes frequently and reliably through automation. CI automates the process of integrating code from multiple contributors, while CD automates the deployment of this code to staging or production environments.

### Why It Matters for This Project
Using a CI/CD pipeline ensures that every code push is automatically tested and deployed, reducing the chances of human error, catching bugs early, and accelerating the development process.

### Tools to Be Used
- **GitHub Actions**: For automating workflows like running tests, linting code, and deploying after a successful push.
- **Docker**: For creating containerized, consistent environments that can run across any infrastructure.
- **Heroku / Render / Railway** (optional): For automated deployment of the backend to a live environment.
